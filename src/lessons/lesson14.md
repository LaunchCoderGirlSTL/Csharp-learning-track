* Create a program with 2 pages. The first page has a text box to enter the user's first name and a text box to enter the user's last name. Add a Display Name button that navigates the user to a second page and displays their full name. You should do this by passing the first name and the last name as separate parameters to the second page without using global variables in the application class. The challenge here is that you can only pass a single parameter to another page. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 14-1. **Hint**: Create a Person class
* Complete the [Hamburger Heaven Challenge](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/windows-10-development-for-absolute-beginners-14541?l=5R7qfk0qB_6005244527). Upload your program to a new repository called CG 14-2.
