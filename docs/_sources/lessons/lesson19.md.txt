* [Read the instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/monetize/adcontrol-in-xaml-and--net) for adding advertisements to you app.  Use this control to add an advertisement to the album cover project like what Bob has done
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/windows-10-development-for-absolute-beginners-14541?l=J8yqoADrB_7805632527) to add in-app purchases for advertising removal to the album cover project
* Watch [this video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/A-Developers-Guide-to-Windows-10/09) from Channel 9 that goes more in depth on file management

## Learning Objectives
* Work with special file folders like documents, music, pictures and videos
* Read metadata from files
* Use story boards to animate controls
* Monetize your application with advertisements
* Monetize your application with in-app purchases

* Code along with Bob to create the Album Cover Match Game application.  Again, please be sure to comment your code.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 19-1
* Update the application to start playing the song in the middle instead of the beginning.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 19-2
* Create a new program with a large multiline text box and save button.  When the user’s clicks the save, it will save the contents to a file.  You do not need to let the user choose the file location.  When the user restarts the application, it should automatically load the contents of this file.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 19-3
* Update the previous program by removing the save button and having the file save changes automatically.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 19-4
