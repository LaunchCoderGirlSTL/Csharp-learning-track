## In-class Work
Here's a video of what we did in class:

## Assignments
* Take the [Working with Code Files, Projects, and Solutions Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Kcqx4iIPC_1705244527) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas.
* Take the [Understanding Data Types and Variables Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=vq8jiCSIC_3706218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas.
* Modify your HelloWorld program to prompt the user for their name and greet them by name. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 2-1.
* Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle and print the answer to the console. You should prompt the user for the dimensions. (What data types should the dimensions be?) Upload your program to a new repository called CG 2-2.
* Create a program that combines three strings input by the user into one and prints the value to the console. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 2-3.

## Errata
* **Working with Code Files, Projects, and Solutions:** The list of files in Bob's project will be slightly different than in yours. This is because we're using a newer version of .NET  
* **Working with Code Files, Projects, and Solutions:** Your default folder for projects may be under a Source folder instead of Documents folder. This change depends on the extensions and install options you choose. You can save your solutions and project anywhere you want, but I would discourage saving them to folders like OneDrive or DropBox
* **Understanding Data Types and Variables:** Please make sure you select Console Application (.NET Core) as the project types again for these examples and all further examples.
