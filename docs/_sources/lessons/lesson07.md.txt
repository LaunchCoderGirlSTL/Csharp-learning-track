# Lesson 7: Classes
## Prep Work
* Read [this article](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~cs3443/ch01.html) on the very basics of objects and how they are used in programming
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=LK8n0uQIC_306218949) about Understanding Classes from the C# for Absolute Beginners course
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=ymM4awQIC_5206218949), More About Classes and Methods, from the C# for Absolute Beginners course
* Bob does not cover inheritance, but it is an important part of object-oriented programming. Read [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance) from Microsoft that explains what inheritance is an how to use it
* Read [this article](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/classDiagram.htm) that explains how to draw diagrams to represent real-world concepts. These diagrams help you plan your code for more complex problems before writing it

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the difference between a class and an object
* Define your own custom class
* Create an instance or object from that class
* Add properties to classes
* Add methods to classes
* Understand the lifetime of an object and when it is removed from memory
* Explain what garbage collection is
* Add a constructor to your class
* Understand the `this` keyword
* Create static methods and classes
* Understand and use inheritance when creating your classes
* Draw diagrams of object-oriented based solutions

## In-class Work
Here is a video of what we did in class:

## Assignments
* Take the [Understanding Classes Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=LK8n0uQIC_306218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas
* Take the [More About Classes and Methods Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=LK8n0uQIC_306218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas
* If you have a project idea or two brewing, try to model out what you think the objects and classes would look like. If you don't have an idea yet, pretend you are going to create a timesheet application where employees can log their work hours, sick time and vacation time and create a model of what that might look like. Upload your diagrams to a new repository called CG 7-1. You don't need to use software to complete this; just draw it on a whiteboard or paper or use index cards and take a picture of it. If you have a tablet or laptop that you can draw with, like an iPad Pro or Surface, that also works well
* As a second run at modeling, try to model out the classes and objects you would find in the game of checkers. Upload your diagrams to a new repository called CG 7-2
* Create a program that contains a deck of cards and randomly draws one. You will need a Card class to store information about each individual card. The Card class should have a method that gives you the full card name like "2 of Hearts". You will need a Deck class that contains an array of all the cards. The Deck class will need a method to draw a random card. Your main method in the Program class should create a deck object, draw a random card and display the value. Upload your diagrams to a new repository called CG 7-3
