Course Overview
===============

C# (pronounced C-Sharp) is used primarily on Windows-based machines and has been widely adopted by companies around the world as their software standard. The .NET Framework is a combination of code and environment that provides a common runtime platform. Similar to Java, application developers can use their C# skills to develop for large server-based systems, desktop applications and even mobile apps. This track is great for someone just getting started with programming who is interested in learning a highly employable language with multiple applications. Student laptops must be less than four years old, have a minimum 4GB RAM, and i5 or i7 processor.
