* Code along with Bob to create the Hero Explorer application.  Again, please be sure to comment your code.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 20-1
* Extend Hero Explorer by caching all results that come back from the API.  You will do this by saving the JSON data into a Dictionary with the key being the URL of the request.  When a user makes the exact same request used the cached JSON data to populate the return results.  You will not want to cache the request that returns a list of random characters or you will always get the same results.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 20-2
* Extend Hero Explorer with the ability to search for characters instead of just getting a random result set.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 20-3
