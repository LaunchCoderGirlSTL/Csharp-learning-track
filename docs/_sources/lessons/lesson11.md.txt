# Lesson 11: Exceptions and Events
## Prep Work
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=NUjUyKRIC_2106218949) about Gracefully Handling Exceptions from the C# for Absolute Beginners course
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=WZ4BFLRIC_2606218949), Understanding Events and Event-Driven Programming, from the C# for Absolute Beginners course
* Watch [this video](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=N9J5qLRIC_7806218949) and enjoy your accomplishment
* Add [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josefpihrt.Roslynator2017) to Visual Studio to help you write better code
* Add [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EWoodruff.VisualStudioSpellCheckerVS2017andLater) to help with silly typos
* Add [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SteveCadwallader.CodeMaid) to Visual Studio to keep your code organized
* Browse [this list](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vs) of available extensions for Visual Studio to see all the possibilities. **Warning**: Don't go overboard with extensions at first; they can overload you with too many options.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain the difference between a compile error and a runtime error
* Remember that ALL INPUT IS EVIL
* Use `try catch` statements to handle exceptions
* Use multiple `catch` statements to handle different types of exceptions
* Use `finally` statements to run after an exception
* Listen for an event and execute code
* Stop listening for an event
* Install some useful extensions to Visual Studio to make your life easier

## In-class Work
Here is a video of what we did in class:

## Assignments
* Take the [Gracefully Handling Exceptions Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=NUjUyKRIC_2106218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas
* Take the [Understanding Events and Event-Driven Programming Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=WZ4BFLRIC_2606218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas
* Create a basic calculator app that lets the user enter a basic formula like `10 + 4`. If the user enters in any invalid data, catch the error and let the user know their input was bad. This application should be able to do addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. You should also be using a calculator class instead of putting everything in the Program class. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 11-1
* Create a basic timer application that lets the user set a timer in minutes, seconds, hours or a combination thereof. Think of it as a command line version of setting a timer through Siri or an Amazon Echo. Try to make it as flexible as possible to all kinds of crazy input command. Make sure to document your program well with comments and create the proper classes and objects. Don't forget your new error handling skills. Upload your program to a new repository call CG 11-2
* Celebrate your completion of C# Fundamentals!
