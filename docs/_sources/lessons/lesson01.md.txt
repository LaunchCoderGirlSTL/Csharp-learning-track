## Errata
* **Course Introduction:** Bob talks about Visual Studio 2015. We will be using Visual Studio 2017. Except for the installation experience, there are not major differences.
* **Creating Your First C# Program:** When you are creating a new project, you may notice 2 different Console App project templates under Visual C#, Console App (.NET Core) and Console App (.NET Framework). We will be using Console App (.NET Core) throughout this course. There are some subtle differences and to avoid confusion, we want all students choosing the same one. For now, just know that .NET Core is the most up to date version of .NET that launched in 2016.
* **Creating Your First C# Program:** The word Start next to the play button in the toolbar is now the name of your project instead.
