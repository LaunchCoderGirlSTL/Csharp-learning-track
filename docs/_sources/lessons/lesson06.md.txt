# Lesson 6: Strings and Dates
## Prep Work
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=xV66IaQIC_3806218949) on Working with Strings from the C# for Absolute Beginners course
* Read [this online tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/string-interpolation) on a new way of manipulating strings in C# called interpolation. This was not available when Bob recorded the videos
* Watch and code along with [this lesson](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=ZSmQMdQIC_5106218949), Working with Dates and Times, from the C# for Absolute Beginners course

## Learning Objectives
* Handle special characters in strings
* Format strings with numbers and dates
* Search for and replace characters in a string
* Convert strings to upper or lower case
* Use the newer string interpolation method
* Format dates and times
* Add and subtract with dates and times
* Determine the amount of time between two dates

## In-class Work
Here is a video of what we did in class:

## Assignments
* Take the [Working with Strings Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=QFuG3iSIC_2106218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas
* Take the [Working with Dates and Times Assessment](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=B5P6fkSIC_8306218949) and upload a screenshot of your score into Canvas
* Create a program that asks the user to enter their first name. Then have it enter their last name. Create a method that combines the first and last name and returns it as a new value. Print the new value. This is like the previous class, but this time use StringBuilder. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 6-1
* Create a program that converts a normal sentence input by the user into all upper case and prints the value to the console. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 2-5.
* Create a program that counts the number of days between two different dates both input by the user. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 6-2.
* The first sentence of Alice in Wonderland is below. Store this sentence in a string, and then prompt the user for a string to search for within this string. Print whether or not the search term was found. See if you can make the search case-insensitive, so that searching for "alice" prints `true`. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 6-3.

> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

* Create a program that counts the number of days between two different dates both input by the user. Upload your program to a new repository called CG 6-4
* Create a program that asks the user for the date they were born. Display the name of the day they were born on (Ex: Thursday) and the name of the day their next birthday will be on. Finally, display their zodiac symbol and a fake fortune for them. You can get the list of zodiac signs and dates, as well as a sample, from [Bing](). Upload your program to a new repository called CG 6-5.
