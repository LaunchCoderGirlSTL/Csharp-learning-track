# Lesson 21: Where to Go from Here

This is the final class for the CoderGirl C# track.  You have learned the foundation of C# and how to build Windows applications.  This knowledge, while not exhaustive, has taught you to learn how to program and build real applications.  This can carry you forward into any entry level programming position, even those not in C#.

If you are moving on to the project track you will continue your education with the following topics:

* How to [design](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/plan-your-app) and plan a more complex application
* What is [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) development
* How to [store data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017) on a server
* Build [web](https://www.asp.net/) sites and applications
* How to access [relational data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)

## Learning Objectives
* This exercise is to prepare you to continue your education after class.

## Assignments

The Prep Work for the final lesson is only a starting point to a topic.  You will need to search for more information, coding samples and tutorials on you own.

Choose **any one** of the following assignments based on the Prep Work you completed above.

* **Connected Experience:** Create an application that saves some data to roaming data storage.  Test your application on another Windows 10 machine logged into the same account and make sure the data you save can be loaded from the other machine.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1
* **Background Execution:** Create an application that displays the current time.  Add a Live Tile to the application that also shows the current time.  Have the application continue to run in the background after it is closed so that it can continue update the time on the Live Tile.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1
* **Databases:**  Create an application that acts as a to do list.  Store that data in an SQLite database.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1
* **Ink:**  Create an application that loads an image and allows the user to trace over it.  Allow the user to see there tracing without the image also shown.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1
* **Localization:**  Create an application that displays a paragraph of text in a language the user chooses from a list.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1
* **Maps:** Create an application that displays the current location of the user.  Allow the user to put in a destination and tell them how long it will take to get there by car.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1
* **Template Studio:**  Create an application using Template Studio that showcases at least one feature of the toolkit.  You can decide what the application does.  Upload your program to a new repository called CG 23-1

Also complete the following presentation assignment.

* Choose any one of the following topics to research on your own to understand what it is and how it works.  The possible topics include:  [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai), [Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Bots](https://dev.botframework.com/), [Games](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/uwp), [Internet of Things](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot), [Mixed Reality](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality), [Mobile](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/) or Office (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office)
* Create a PowerPoint presentation or Word document on your research topic to explain to the class what it is about and how to develop for it.  You may be asked to give a 5 – 10-minute presentation to the class.  Upload your document to a new repository called CG 23-2
